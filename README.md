# OB-USP-Agent Test Controller

Open Broadband-User Services Platform-Agent Test Controller (OB-USP-Agent Test Controller) is an open source project that takes the  OB-USP-Agent code [Broadband Forum OB-USP-Agent GitHub repository](https://github.com/BroadbandForum/obuspa) and adds functionality to allow the sending of Controller messages from a file.

 USP is a remote management and control protocol where management entities are separated between the Agent and the Controller. A USP Agent is responsible for exposing a set of "Service Elements" (essentially, a data model composed of objects and parameters that represent a specific set of functionality) for consumption by a Controller. While USP is capable of being used in many different environments, the home network is expected to be the most common environment, and in this environment a USP Agent would reside in a piece of Customer Premise Equipment (CPE), e.g. broadband home router, Wi-Fi access point, IoT gateway.
